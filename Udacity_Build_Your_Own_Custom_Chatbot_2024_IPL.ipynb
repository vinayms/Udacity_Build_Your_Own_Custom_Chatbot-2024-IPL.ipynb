        "The technique used is RAG Retrieval Augmented Generation on the broader level. RAG, which stands for Retrieval-Augmented Generation, is a powerful technique in the field of natural language processing (NLP) that combines the strengths of both retrieval-based and generative models. It aims to enhance the quality and relevance of generated responses by incorporating information from a large external knowledge source. By leveraging this contextual information, RAG models can provide more informed responses. For example, if a question is asked about a specific topic, RAG can retrieve relevant information from a knowledge base and use that information to generate a response that is grounded in factual accuracy and context."

Next, parse the HTML content to extract the relevant information, such as paragraphs, tables, or lists. Once you have extracted the data, you can organize it into a structured format, such as 'text' column. This structured data can then be used as input to build embeddings using techniques like word embeddings or document embeddings."
