Project: Create Your Own Custom Chatbot

Extracted from Udacity's curriculum, this project involves the customization of a provided dataset to construct a unique chatbot.

What You'll Develop:
Upon successful completion of this project, you'll have crafted a bespoke OpenAI chatbot tailored to a scenario of your choosing. This encompasses selecting an appropriate dataset, elucidating its relevance to the task at hand, seamlessly integrating it into the chatbot's codebase, and formulating insightful questions to evaluate the chatbot's efficacy.

Overview:

Contained within this repository is the comprehensive solution to Udacity's project aimed at building a Custom Chatbot. The Jupyter notebook encapsulates all executed code cells alongside their corresponding results. To fully utilize the project, you'll require an OpenAI API key, which should be seamlessly integrated into the YOUR_API_KEY constant. It's crucial to bear in mind that the OpenAI client libraries are subject to periodic updates, necessitating consultation of the OpenAPI library specifications for any potential errors pertaining to the OpenAI library.

The overarching goal of this project is to procure responses to custom prompts grounded in contemporary events. While it's understood that OpenAI doesn't offer direct responses to ongoing events, our approach involves supplying nuanced contextual cues and prompts, thereby facilitating the extraction of pertinent information related to current affairs.

Dataset:

For the purpose of this project, I've opted to leverage data extracted from the ongoing 2024 Indian Premier League (IPL) season. This dataset is meticulously curated from Wikipedia's page dedicated to the 2024 Indian Premier League. It's imperative to acknowledge that the data extraction process involves meticulous parsing of HTML tags. Consequently, it's prudent to remain vigilant for any potential alterations to the HTML IDs, which could necessitate adjustments in the event of errors.
